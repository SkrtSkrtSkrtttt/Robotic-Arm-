# Robotic-Arm-
The objective of this project is to create a Robotic Arm that has movement. You will apply the
fundaments that we learned in the class.
Project Process
Management:
1. Form a team and establish some type leadership rules
2. Assign tasks for team members
3. Create a Gantt chart for the project with group member responsibilities (2 weeks)

Robotic Arm Project

Phase #1:
Structure design:
Construct the 3d model using the Autodesk inventor
Step 1: Download all step CAD files of your parts
Step 2: Create the parts of the Robotic arm using the download components
Step 3: 3D Print the parts of the Robotic arm
Step 4: Assemble the components
Note : Use the design process you have learned in the CIM class to guide you through the
different phases of the design
Software design:

1. Get datasheet for the components
2. Get the component specs and extract the pinout information
3. Test your components to see if they are working appropriately (use the
multimeter and the power supply)
4. Learn the theory of operation of the components
5. Build the thinkerCad simulator of the actual system
6. Create testing program for these components
7. Figure out the driving modes and make function to perform these tasks
8. Test your functions

Phase#2:
Final assembly:

1. Wire the components and harness the circuit
2. Troubleshoot and test the circuit using the testing programs created before
3. Program the Robotic arm system
4. Evaluate and test the Robotic arm
5. Modify if necessarily

Phase#3:
Documentation:
1. Create a report explaining the design phases and provide the following:
● Design idea
● Modeling
● Technical drawing
● Mechanical assembly
● System design
● Circuit schematics
● Pictorial diagram
● Wire harnessing
● Programming
● Troubleshooting guide.

● References / datasheet
2. Create a repository for the CAD files and the programs
Presentation:
Create a 12 slides powerpoint presentation
1. Team members and project name
2. Summary of the design
3. Mechanical design

● Technical drawing of the assembly
● Exploded-view

4. System design

● Circuit diagrams
● Programs
● Troubleshooting notes

5. Demo video

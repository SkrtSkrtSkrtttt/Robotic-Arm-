# Robotic Arm Project

This project focuses on designing and building a functional robotic arm using 3D-printed parts and embedded control logic. The system integrates mechanical design, electronics, and software to achieve articulated motion. The robotic arm is intended as a hands-on platform for applying foundational engineering concepts, including component interfacing, motion control, and system integration.

## Objective

- Design and build a robotic arm that demonstrates controlled movement.
- Apply classroom concepts in CAD modeling, embedded systems, and circuit design.
- Manage the project as a team using engineering best practices.

## Project Management

- Team-based collaboration with assigned roles
- Gantt chart used to plan and track tasks over a 2-week timeline
- Follows a structured process across design, implementation, and documentation phases

---

## Phase 1: Mechanical Design

- Use Autodesk Inventor to construct the full 3D model of the robotic arm
- Download STEP/CAD files of all necessary components
- Design and model custom parts using parametric tools
- 3D print the robotic arm components
- Assemble the full mechanical system based on the modeled structure

## Phase 2: Electronics & Software

- Collect datasheets and identify pinouts for all electronic components (e.g. servos, sensors)
- Test individual components using a multimeter and power supply
- Create a TinkerCAD simulation of the full system
- Write testing programs to verify component functionality
- Implement movement control logic (e.g., joint positioning, driving modes)
- Test and refine the functions to ensure reliable behavior
- Wire and program the full robotic arm system
- Evaluate performance and iterate as necessary

## Phase 3: Documentation & Presentation

A complete project report was produced including:
- Design overview and concept development
- 3D models and technical drawings
- Exploded views and mechanical assembly instructions
- System architecture and circuit schematics
- Wire harness diagrams and embedded code
- Troubleshooting guide
- Bill of Materials (BOM) and references

Additionally, a 12-slide PowerPoint presentation was created summarizing:
- Team roles and project objectives
- CAD modeling process
- System design and control logic
- Key challenges and solutions
- Final demo (video may be unavailable)

## Technologies & Tools Used

- Autodesk Inventor (CAD modeling)
- Arduino (Microcontroller platform)
- TinkerCAD (Circuit simulation)
- Arduino C / Embedded C
- 3D Printer (Mechanical part fabrication)
- Multimeter & Power Supply (Component testing)

## Status

Functional robotic arm successfully assembled and programmed to respond to control signals. System can be expanded in the future with additional degrees of freedom or sensor feedback.
